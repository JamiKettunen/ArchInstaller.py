# ArchInstaller.py
A semi-automatic & configurable Arch Linux installer script written in Python.

Actual script configuration is done in the [`config.py`](config.py) module & [`custom_setup()`](setup.py#L24) method found at the top of [`setup.py`](setup.py).

You should already be familiar with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) before using this and be prepared to fix stuff yourself as things may and inevitably **will** go wrong.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is still `alpha` state software and will keep changing in the future.

## Deployment
This is an example of how I'm used to deploying the scripts remotely to a system running the ArchISO environment via ethernet:
```
TARGET #

passwd                –  required to use SSH
systemctl start sshd  –  launching the SSH server Daemon
ip a                  –  get live system IP for SSH / file transfer (e.g. 192.168.1.105)
```
Then to transfer the scripts via terminal from the current directory to the target system:
```
HOST $ scp *.py root@192.168.1.105:/root/
root@192.168.1.105's password:
config.py                                                         100% 6246     2.3MB/s   00:00
setup.py                                                          100%  111KB  73.3MB/s   00:00
```
Using the script is as simple as running it like any other (Python) executable:
```
TARGET # ./setup.py
```
The rest should be self-explanatory when following the instructions during install :)

## Following progress
To follow the progress and view the commands being run by the script, switch to another TTY / login via SSH and do:
```
TARGET # tail -f /tmp/setup.log
```
**NOTE:** This will need to be ended with `Ctrl` + `C` when entering chroot as the file gets moved, you'll then need to run this the command again.

Once the system is installed the log will be moved to `/var/log/setup.log` on the target system for further investigation / removal.
